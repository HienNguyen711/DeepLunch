# Exercises for linear regression

## Problem 1. (Optional)

Implement gradient descent algorithm for linear regression. Test your implementation with some data sets.

- ```ex1data1.txt```: one-variable linear regression
- ```ex1data2.txt```: multivariate linear regression. The first column of the data is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.

## Problem 2.

Using scikit-learn library for linear regression

Use the library scit-learn library for linear regression.

## Problem 3.

Test your implmentation in Problem 1 and Problem 2 using some data sets in
[UCI's linear regression data](http://tinyurl.com/grc6fye).
